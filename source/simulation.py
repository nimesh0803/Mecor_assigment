"""
Part 4 â€” Network Growth Simulation (READ THIS):
- Deterministic expected-value model (no Monte Carlo).
- Start with N0=100 active referrers; each has lifetime capacity C=10.
- On each day, each active referrer can produce at most one successful referral with prob p.
- A referrer becomes inactive once they accumulate C successes (absorbing cap).
- New referrals DO NOT become referrers (per spec; only initial referrers are active).
- simulate(p, days) returns a list "cum[i]" = expected total referrals by end of day i, i=0..days.
- days_to_target(p, target_total) returns the minimum day d with cum[d] >= target_total, or None if target_total > N0*C.

Complexity:
- simulate:  O(days * C) via DP on a single-referrer success distribution, then scale by N0.
- days_to_target: O(d * C), where d is the returned day (early-exit). Both C and N0 are constants (10, 100).
